Note: Thank you so much. I’m super happy to get to share a few ideas with you about how to deal with the overflow of stuff facing you in your professional lives. I have to begin, however,


<big>YMMV</big>

Note: with a great big caveat: Your Mileage May Vary. Which is to say that there is a ton of advice circulating, and you’ll get a bunch of it here today too, and lots of that advice is good but not all of it will work for you. On email management, for instance: lots of people will tell you that you should only check your email a couple of times a day. And I get that: if you can really, genuinely ignore your inbox other than during those times, it opens up a lot of brain space! But that would never in a million years work for me, and I can feel my heart rate climbing just contemplating it – I cannot bear not knowing what’s piling up in my inbox while I’m not looking. What I would instead suggest is that you need to figure out your own best work flow – which times of day are most productive for you, for what kinds of work, and what methods of time and inbox management work best for you. And all of that requires a fair bit of experimentation.


# Email
<span class=”fragment”>- Don’t use your inbox as a to-do list!</span>

Note: So, with that said, a few thoughts on email. 


- so, with that said, a few thoughts on email:
	- as my co-panelists here have said/will say, I have found that using my email inbox as a to-do list is a HUGE error, not least because I start breaking out in hives when my inbox has more than about ten things in it, and my to-do list is ALWAYS longer than that
	- not to mention that when the list of things in my inbox gets long enough that I have to scroll, I'm going to start forgetting stuff -- if it's not right in front of me, it doesn't exist
	- So I try to deal with email as quickly as I can -- if a message can be dealt with in less than a minute or so, I try to take care of it right away, unless I'm in a period of focused work
	- if a message requires more consideration than that, or if it requires me to do something, I get it into my to-do workflow and either archive the message or use the Snooze function to have it reappear in my inbox at a point when I can deal with it
	- and as my colleagues will note, I try to move as much internal communication out of email as possible -- my research team and related colleagues rely heavily on Teams for most things
- my to-do workflow has changed a lot in the last couple of years
	- I used to use Things, which had Mac and iOS apps and really good organizational mechanisms
	- but then a couple of years ago, I started using Obsidian for note-taking
	- Obsidian is a free application that allows you to use Markdown, which is a very simple formatting markup, in order to create rich notes in a folder of text files that always stays on your own computer
	- it's a powerful replacement for something like Evernote, which uses a proprietary format to keep your notes locked in; since with Obsidian your files are just plain text, and all on your local machine, you can easily switch to another application if you want
	- Obsidian is not an open-source platform -- the primary code base is maintained by its own team -- but it is open to community extension, and so hundreds of Obsidian users have created open-source plugins that add all kinds of functionality to the base platform
	- one of those plugins is Obsidian Tasks, which is now the center of my workflow
	- Obsidian Tasks recognizes that many of us create "to do" items for ourselves in the course of taking notes on a meeting or planning out a project
	- Tasks uses queries to gather any item in your notes that has a checkbox and fits the parameters you set (like a particular hashtag) into one place, regardless of where it originated
	- I also use a plugin called Kanban to allow me to see and order all the stuff I need to do (my backlog), the stuff I'm planning to do today, and the stuff I've completed
	- And there's a plugin called ICS that allows me to pull in my daily schedule from my calendar 
	- And finally I use the Daily Notes function with a template that compiles my schedule, my to-dos for the day, and space for the day's journaling and notes
- this is SUPER overkill for most people, and mostly reflects that I derive a kind of geeky pleasure in fiddling with my organizational tools, and will totally not work for anyone who doesn't
	- which brings me back to my point that you really need to think through how you work and what you need from your workflow
	- one thing I know I need is to be sure that absolutely everything is captured in my to-do workflow, because if it's not there I won't remember it -- or rather, I will remember it, at 2am in a cold sweat -- so I make sure that I create a task for everything as it arrives in my email, or in Teams, or in a meeting
	- I also know that I need to protect blocks of time for reading, writing, and thinking, and that I do my best focused work first thing in the morning, before the day interferes, so I have blocked off the 8am to 10am block on my calendar for focused work, and only interrupt that time for college-level and higher meetings or special events like this one!
	- I also try to preserve time on my schedule for exercise, knowing that it's the first thing I'll give up when things get busy
	- and I know from experience that I am no good at all after 5pm, so I try to be sure things are shut down before then
- every morning, as early as I can get myself to sit down, I create my daily note and do a bit of journaling, reflecting on the days before as well as the day ahead, and then turn to whatever the primary thing I need to focus on it, before the meetings start
- every Sunday, I review the week that's just ended, as well as the week ahead, to get myself oriented to what's ahead
- and every single day, I try to take several very short breaks to breathe and settle into where I am
- my process is far from perfect, but it helps keep the anxiety at bay, and honestly that's a lot
